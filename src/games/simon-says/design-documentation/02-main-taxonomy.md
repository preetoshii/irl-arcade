# Main Taxonomy

*This document defines all core terms and concepts used throughout the Simon Says game system.*

## Match
A complete game experience from start to finish. A Match is composed of multiple Blocks arranged in sequence. Think of it like a complete "show" or "game session" that players participate in from opening ceremony to closing celebration.

## Block
The fundamental building unit of a Match. Each Block is a self-contained segment of gameplay with a specific purpose and duration. Blocks are like LEGO pieces that can be arranged to create different Match experiences. There are four types of Blocks: Round Block, Relax Block, Ceremony Block.

## Ceremony Block
Special Blocks that bookend the Match, creating ritual moments that bring players together. The Opening Ceremony Block welcomes players, builds hype, explains the game. The Closing Ceremony Block celebrates the experience, acknowledges winners (if any), and provides closure. Ceremonies are typically Simon-led performances that set the tone for what's to come or celebrate what just happened.

## Round Block
The main gameplay Blocks where active competition or challenges occur. These are the heart of Simon Says - where players actually play. Round Blocks have multiple layers of selection: Round Type (Duel, Team, Free-for-All, etc.), Variant (specific game like Tag or Mirror), Sub-variant (movement style like Crab Walk), and optional Modifiers (extra spice like blindfolds). Each Round Block produces high energy and engagement.

## Relax Block
Recovery Blocks that provide breathing room between intense Round Blocks. These are group activities designed to lower the energy, let players recover, create dynamic pacing, and maintain social cohesion. Examples include group stretching, breathing exercises, or silly low-energy activities. Relax Blocks prevent exhaustion and create rhythm in the Match.

## Play
The final output of the selection process - a fully-specified, ready-to-perform game moment. A Play contains everything needed for execution: which players, what activity, what rules, what modifications, and what scripts to use. For example: "Blindfolded Crab Walk Tag Duel between Alice (Red Team) and Bob (Blue Team)" is a complete Play. Simon receives a Play and performs it theatrically.

## Simon
The AI conductor/host of the game, voiced through text-to-speech. Simon is the theatrical heart of the experience - part game show host, part sports announcer, part improv performer. Simon takes the pre-selected Plays and delivers them with dramatic flair, managing pacing, building suspense, and creating memorable moments. Players don't know that everything is pre-selected; to them, Simon is making dynamic decisions in real-time.
