# Relax Block

*This document describes relaxation activities that appear between rounds.*

## Overview
Relax Blocks are a spontaneous but unpredicted space of breathing room of Simon Says - group activities designed to lower intensity while maintaining engagement. Unlike passive breaks where players might check phones or wander off, Relax Blocks keep everyone together through gentle, inclusive activities. They prevent exhaustion, create bonding moments, and add variety to the match rhythm.

## When They Appear

Relax Blocks are pre-planned based on the match pattern selected:
- **Pattern-based**: Each match length has predefined patterns that include Relax Blocks at strategic intervals
- **Example**: A 10-round match might follow "3 rounds → relax → 3 rounds → relax → 4 rounds"
- **No dynamic insertion**: The pattern is chosen at match start and followed throughout
- **Strategic placement**: Patterns are designed to prevent exhaustion while maintaining momentum
