# Round Block

*This document details the main block type - active gameplay rounds.*

## Overview
Round Blocks are where the action happens. They follow a layered selection system, starting from broad categories and drilling down to specific details. This creates enormous variety while maintaining coherent gameplay. Each layer adds specificity until we have a complete Play ready for Simon to perform.



## Round Types
The highest level categorization that determines the basic player dynamics:



### Team Battle (35% default weight)
Team-based competitions where groups work together. Can be full teams or subsets. Builds team cohesion and allows for more complex gameplay dynamics. Good for including many players simultaneously while fostering collaboration.

### Duel Battle (30% default weight)
One-on-one competition between two players, typically from opposing teams. Creates intimate, focused moments where everyone watches two players compete. Perfect for building individual narratives and rivalries. Lower weight due to fewer active participants.

### Asymmetric Battle (20% default weight)
A small (or 1) number of players from one team vs all players from another team. Allows for tense drama and power dynamics (Player 1, keep distance from team 2. Now RUN!). Still inclusive as many players participate, but creates unique dynamics.

### Free For All (20% default weight)
Everyone plays at once with individual goals. Creates beautiful chaos and ensures nobody sits out. Energy tends to be highest in these rounds. Works well with any player count. Most inclusive option since everyone participates simultaneously.



## Variants
The specific game or activity within a Round Type. Each Round Type has its own set of Variants:

### Duel Variants
- **Tag**: Classic chase game - one player is "it"
- **Mirror**: Copy your opponent's movements
- **Balance**: See who can hold a position longest
- **Race**: First to complete a challenge wins
- **Battle**: Competitive actions (rock-paper-scissors variations)

### Team Variants
- **Relay**: Sequential challenges passed between teammates
- **Capture the Flag**: Classic team territorial game
- **Tug of War**: Physical or challenge-based team pulling
- **Collective Challenge**: Teams work together on tasks

### Free For All Variants
- **Elimination**: Last person standing games
- **Collection**: Gather the most of something
- **Freeze Dance**: Musical movement games
- **Follow the Pattern**: Simon Says style commands




## Sub-variants
Movement styles or constraints that modify how a Variant is played:

### Universal Sub-variants (work with many Variants)
- **Normal**: Standard movement and rules
- **Crab Walk**: Must move in crab position
- **Hop**: One-foot hopping only
- **Backwards**: Everything in reverse
- **Slow Motion**: Exaggerated slow movement
- **Animal Style**: Move like specific animals
- **Silent**: No talking allowed
- **Linked**: Players must hold hands/stay connected




## Fun Modifiers
Optional layers that add spice to any Round + Variant + Sub-variant combination. These modifiers should use a different element of the players than is being utilized by the variant + subvariants so that they can be applied universally to anything. Which is why "chanting" is a good example, as it uses the mouth while everything else is involved with the body.

### Sound Modifiers
- **Team Chant**: Must chant team name while playing
- **Animal Noises**: Can only make animal sounds
- **Opera Mode**: Everything sung operatically
- **Whisper Only**: Super quiet gameplay

### Silly Modifiers
- **Silly Voices**: Must use funny voices
- **Dance Moves**: Incorporate specific dance moves


**Result**: "[Player 1], tag [Player 2] ... while both of you do a crab walk ... while chanting your team names- Alice is it!"

This layered system creates hundreds of possible combinations while ensuring each one makes sense and is playable. The weights at each level can be adjusted based on group preferences, time of day, or energy levels.
