# Match Flow

*This document describes how a complete match unfolds from start to finish.*

## Overall Match Duration and Pacing

### Standard Match Choices
Instead of choosing minutes, choose rounds.
- **Quick Match**: 5 rounds
- **Standard Match**: 10 rounds (optimal engagement without exhaustion)
- **Extended Match**: 15 rounds (for dedicated groups or special events)
- **Marathon Match**: 30 rounds (intense or very engaged groups)

### Time Estimations 
- Opening Ceremony: 1 minute-ish
- Round Block: ~1-3 minutes-ish
- Relax Blocks: ~1-3 minutes-ish
- Closing Ceremony: 1 minute-ish

### Pacing Principles
- **Start Strong**: First round should be universally engaging
- **Build Gradually**: Increase complexity/intensity over first third
- **Peak Middle**: Highest difficulty in middle third
- **Strategic Relief**: Well-timed Relax Blocks before energy crashes
- **Strong Finish**: Last rounds memorable but not exhausting
- **Graceful Close**: Ceremony brings energy down smoothly
