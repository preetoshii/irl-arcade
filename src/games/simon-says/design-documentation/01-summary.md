# Summary

*This document covers the game vision, goals, key features, and core system paradigm.*

## Game Vision and Goals

### Vision
Simon Says reimagines the classic children's game as a sophisticated, AI-driven outdoor activity system that brings people together through movement, laughter, and shared experiences. By combining the simplicity of "follow the leader" with the intelligence of modern game design, we create magical moments where technology enhances rather than replaces human connection.

### Core Goals

**Bring People Together**
In an increasingly digital world, Simon Says creates reasons for people to gather in parks, playgrounds, and open spaces. The game is merely the excuse - the real product is human connection, shared laughter, and collective joy.

**Inclusive by Design**
Every design decision prioritizes accessibility and inclusion. Whether you're 5 or 85, athletic or sedentary, outgoing or shy, Simon Says finds a way to include you. The game adapts to its players, not the other way around.

**Intelligent Simplicity**
Behind the simple exterior lies sophisticated systems for pacing, variety, and engagement. Players experience effortless fun while the system handles complex orchestration, like a swan gliding smoothly while paddling furiously underwater.

**Outdoor First**
Designed specifically for outdoor play, the game embraces the constraints and opportunities of parks, beaches, and fields. Audio-driven gameplay works in bright sunlight, requires no equipment, and scales from 4 to 100+ players.

## Key Features

### The AI Conductor - Simon
At the heart of the experience is Simon, an AI game master who orchestrates every match with theatrical flair. Through sophisticated variety algorithms and round-by-round selection, Simon creates unique experiences every time. Players experience Simon as a charismatic host delivering perfectly timed surprises and delightful combinations.

### Infinitely Variable Gameplay
Through a layered selection system (Round Types → Variants → Sub-variants → Modifiers), Simon Says generates hundreds of possible game combinations. A simple game of tag can become "Blindfolded Crab Walk Tag with Team Chanting" - familiar yet fresh, accessible yet surprising.

### Visual Game Design with Mermaid
Game designers and developers can modify gameplay by editing visual flowcharts. The Mermaid-driven system means changes are immediately reflected in gameplay, version-controlled, and understandable by non-programmers. The chart IS the game, not just documentation.

### Simple Difficulty Progression
The Difficulty System provides predictable challenge progression throughout a match. Each Play has a difficulty score (1-5), and the game follows a predetermined curve from easy warm-ups to challenging finales. Higher difficulty also means faster pacing through reduced pauses. Players can choose different difficulty curves (gentle, steady, or roller coaster) when starting a match.

### Resilient State Management
Real-world games are messy - players arrive late, take breaks, phones die, weather changes. The state system gracefully handles every scenario, allowing players to come and go while maintaining game continuity. Checkpoints ensure no progress is ever lost.

### Block-Based Architecture
Matches are built from modular Blocks - Round Blocks for gameplay, Relax Blocks for recovery, Ceremony Blocks for rituals. This architecture allows infinite variety while maintaining structural coherence. Like LEGO bricks, simple pieces combine into complex experiences.

### Variety Enforcement
Sophisticated algorithms ensure every player gets turns, no activity repeats too often, and patterns don't become predictable. The system tracks participation, recent selections, and energy patterns to keep experiences fresh while maintaining fairness.

### Theatrical Performance System
Pre-selected game configurations are delivered with dynamic timing, contextual scripts, and responsive pacing. Players experience spontaneous, reactive gameplay while the system ensures smooth execution. It's dinner theater where the audience doesn't know there's a script.

## Core System Paradigm

### Pre-selection with Theatrical Delivery

The genius of Simon Says lies in its core paradigm: **everything is pre-selected, but nothing feels predetermined**. Before each round begins, the system has already chosen every detail - who will play, what they'll do, which modifiers to add. This pre-selection enables:

**Reliable Experiences**
By selecting everything upfront, the system can ensure sensible combinations, appropriate difficulty curves, and balanced participation. No awkward moments of incompatible rules or impossible challenges.

**Theatrical Excellence**
Like a master magician preparing each trick moments before performing it, Simon selects each round's play just before delivering it. This round-by-round selection allows adaptation to changing player lists while maintaining theatrical timing. The performance can focus on HOW things are revealed, with each round freshly selected based on current players.

**Intelligent Pacing**
Knowing exactly what's coming allows precise time management. The system can promise "10 rounds in 30 minutes" and deliver, adjusting performance speed rather than cutting content.

**Graceful Handling**
When interruptions occur - a player injury, sudden rain, technical glitch - the system can smoothly adapt because it's not committed to real-time decisions. Pre-selection provides flexibility, not rigidity.

### The Magic is in the Performance

Players never know about pre-selection. To them, Simon is making dynamic decisions in the moment. Through careful scripting, strategic pauses, and theatrical delivery, each freshly-selected round feels spontaneous and perfectly timed.

Consider this moment: The system has pre-selected "Blindfolded Crab Walk Tag." But players experience:
- "Let's see what's next..." (Simon already knows)
- "I'm thinking... TAG!" (predetermined, but feels decided)
- "Actually, let's make it interesting..." (scripted surprise)
- "CRAB WALK ONLY!" (delivered with perfect timing)

### One-Way Communication Architecture

A fundamental design constraint shapes the entire system: **Simon can only speak, never listen**. There is no feedback mechanism from players back to the system. Simon cannot know:
- Who won or lost any round
- How tired or energetic players are
- Whether players are struggling or succeeding
- If anyone is injured or needs help
- The actual score or game state

Simon only knows:
- Which players joined the match initially
- If a player has explicitly left the match (removed from app)
- The pre-selected sequence of activities
- How much time has passed

This constraint is not a limitation but a design choice that:
- **Keeps the game human-centered** - Players self-regulate, self-score, and self-monitor
- **Reduces technology complexity** - No cameras, sensors, or tracking needed
- **Increases accessibility** - Works anywhere with just audio output
- **Encourages honesty and sportsmanship** - Players are trusted to play fair
- **Maintains flow** - No stopping to input results or status

Simon's scripts are carefully crafted to work within this constraint, using phrases like "Count up your points!" rather than "The score is..." and "If you need a break, step back!" rather than detecting exhaustion.

### System Philosophy

**Technology in Service of Humanity**
Every technical decision supports human connection. Complex systems create simple experiences. AI enhances rather than replaces human judgment.

**Designed for Delight**
Beyond functional requirements, every element should spark joy. Silly modifiers, unexpected combinations, and playful language create memories, not just gameplay.

**Resilient by Nature**
Real-world environments are unpredictable. Every system assumes interruption, adaptation, and recovery as normal, not exceptional states.

**Accessible Excellence**
Great design is invisible. Players of all abilities should feel included naturally, not accommodated specially. The best accessibility features are the ones no one notices.

## Conclusion

Simon Says represents a new category of outdoor social gaming - intelligent enough to handle complexity, simple enough for anyone to play, and designed specifically for the messiness and magic of real-world group dynamics. It's not just a game; it's a platform for human connection, a catalyst for community, and a demonstration that the future of play might just be outside, together, laughing at a computer's silly voice telling us to hop like crabs.

The system stands ready to create millions of unique experiences, each one pre-selected for success but performed with the spontaneity and joy that makes memories. In parks and playgrounds around the world, Simon is waiting to say: "Welcome, everyone! Let's play!"
