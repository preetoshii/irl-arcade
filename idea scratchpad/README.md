## Ideas Scratchpad

This is where game ideas live and breathe. Each file captures a single idea that you just want to jot down to remember.

Ideas here are free-form and exploratory. They're written in natural language, focusing on the player experience and what makes each idea fun or interesting. Just tell Claude Code (or Cursor) that you want to add an ide ato the Idea Scratchpad and feel free to messily state your idea, and it will neatly capture it in this folder.

These aren't specifications or feature requests - they're captured inspiration. Some might become mechanics, some might merge with other ideas, and some might just be fun to read later. It's a space for those ideas that you just want to have captured somewhere, even if they're crazy.

Each idea gets its own file so it has room to be fully expressed without competing for attention. The filenames are descriptive (like `musical-mayhem-mode.md` or `ghost-whisper-mechanic.md`) so you can quickly scan and find that idea you were excited about last week.
