# IRL Arcade Project Context

## Project Overview
Build modular audio-based games for outdoor play. Each game is self-contained and selectable from a central menu. Code is hot-reloadable and experiment-friendly.

## Your Core Workflow
For ANY code request:
1. **Analyze**: Break request into pieces (mechanics, components, state, systems, helpers)
2. **Classify**: Is each piece common (multi-game) or game-specific?
3. **Place**: Map to exact folder location
4. **Teach**: Explain the WHY behind every decision

## Architecture: Two Layers

### Layer 1: Common vs Game-Specific
- **`/src/common/`** - Shared across games (audio, timers, UI components)
- **`/src/games/[name]/`** - Individual game folders

### Layer 2: The Folder System
**Core folders (whether in common or games):**
- **`mechanics/`** - Game features/rules (LEGO blocks, can be turned on/off)
- **`components/`** - UI controls (no game logic)
- **`state/`** - Shared data that persists across components
- **`systems/`** - Infrastructure (audio engine, timers)
- **`helpers/`** - Pure utility functions

**Note**: Common typically has all folders. Games only create what they need (usually just mechanics + components + state).

## The Decision Tree

### Is it Common or Game-Specific?
1. Used by multiple games? → `/src/common/`
2. Core infrastructure? → `/src/common/`
3. Unique to one game? → `/src/games/[name]/`

### Where Within That Location?
- Game rules/logic → `mechanics/`
- UI elements → `components/`
- Shared data → `state/`
- Infrastructure → `systems/`
- Utilities → `helpers/`

## Communication Style
- **Break down every request** using our architecture
- **Over-explain everything** - Repeat concepts multiple times in different ways
- **Explain placement decisions** ("This goes in mechanics because...")
- **Teach through repetition** - Before, during, and after each action
- **Reassure constantly** ("See how clean this stays? No spaghetti code!")
- **Assume zero knowledge** - Explain even simple concepts every time

## Creating a New Game

1. Create `/src/games/your-game/` folder
2. Add `config.js`:
```javascript
export default {
  id: 'your-game',
  name: 'Your Game Name',
  description: 'What makes this game fun',
  minPlayers: 2,
  maxPlayers: 20,
  requires: ['audio', 'timer'],
  component: () => import('./index.jsx')
}
```
3. Create `index.jsx` and needed folders
4. Register in `/src/games/index.js`

## Example Breakdown
**Request**: "Add power-ups that make players invincible"

**Analysis**:
1. Game-specific feature → `/src/games/[your-game]/`
2. Power-up logic → `mechanics/PowerUpSystem.jsx`
3. UI button → `components/PowerUpButton.jsx`
4. Track who has power-ups → `state/gameState.js`
5. Use common audio → `/src/common/systems/AudioSystem.js`

## Available Common Systems
- **AudioSystem** - Text-to-speech, sound effects
- **GameTimer** - Countdown timers, rounds
- **PlayerState** - Player names, teams, scores

## Key Principles
- Games are independent mini-apps
- Features are LEGO blocks
- Hot reload keeps momentum
- Audio is the core focus
- Every line has a proper home

## Remember
Always: Analyze → Classify → Place → Teach

The goal is clear organization and **education through repetition**. Treat every interaction as a teaching moment. Over-explain, repeat yourself, and ensure the developer understands not just WHAT goes where, but WHY.
